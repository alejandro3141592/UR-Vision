# UR-Vision

This repository contains the work I made for the ADIENT company. They wanted to automate the process of screwing a certain piece, so using a camera as an Eye In the Sky and a UR10 robotic arm, I made a vision system that detected the position of the screws, and then using a Coordinate Transformation, I got the position of the Screws in the robot Reference Frame. With this, and using the software of RoboDK, I was able to control the robot's movements, have a cyber-physical system of this part of the process in RoboDK, and send information about the piece to a dashboard in the cloud.

You can find more information about the algorithms I made in the [codes](https://github.com/alejandro3141592/UR-Vision/tree/1280377e6da75b53db022f97a132acd944cce6f1/codes) folder.
